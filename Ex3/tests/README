-- OS 2017 - ex 3 test suite --
By Jona Harris


The suite depends on 2 files: your library file 'MapReduceFramework.a' and your compiled program 'Search'

Steps:

- Place 'MapReduceFramework.a' inside the 'Framework' directory.
- Place 'Search' inside the 'Test_496' directory.
- run 'compile_suite' to compile all tests.
- run 'run_suite' to run the tests sequentially.



Test 6:
A description of the test is inside the Test_6 directory.
The test is being run with 3 different inputs of different difficulty levels (grid5, grid25, grid125).


Test 28:
Finding words frequencies in a text. There are 3 text files as inputs for the test.


Test 496:
Test for the Search program. There are two inputs for this test - light_data and heavy_data (whose names suggest about their difficulty).
There are 2 additional scripts in Test_496:
'runValgrind' - run the test on both inputs using valgrind and write valgrind's log to two files valgrind_light.out and valgrind_heavy.out
'stress' - run the test many times in a loop (may be good to check there aren't any concurrency problems)



Have fun...
